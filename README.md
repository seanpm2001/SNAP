# Hardware Support to Improve Fuzzing Performance and Precision

SNAP is a customized hardware platform that implements hardware primitives
to enhance the performance and precision of coverage-guided fuzzing.
We implemented SNAP on top of the [RISC-V BOOM core](https://boom-core.org),
which has one of the most sophisticated designs among the open-source processors.
SNAP was prototyped in the [FireSim](https://fires.im)
platform that runs on cloud FPGAs (Amazon EC2 F1).

To run SNAP, you would need to replace the existing HW design directory (generator)
with the SNAP's one and build a new HW design that will be mapped to FPGA instances.
While all the necessary instructions to run FPGA instances
are provided in the [FireSimâ€™s documentation](https://docs.fires.im/en/latest/index.html),
we add some detailed steps that might not be clearly indicated in the documentation.

## Initial Setup/Installation for FireSim

Please refer to the [FireSim documentation](https://docs.fires.im/en/latest/Initial-Setup/index.html).

## Setting up the FireSim Repo

When you set up a manager instance during
the [initial setup process](https://github.com/sslab-gatech/SNAP#initial-setupinstallation-for-firesim),
check out a specific tag, `1.9.0`.

```
git clone https://github.com/firesim/firesim.git
cd firesim
git checkout 1.9.0 # command to check out a specific tag
./build-setup.sh fast
```

## Replacing the Existing "generator" Directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/sslab-gatech/SNAP.git .
rm -rf ~/firesim/generator
cp -rf ./SNAP/generator ~/firesim/
```

## Building a New HW Design for SNAP

1. In `~/firesim/deploy/config_build.ini`,
- Under `[afibuild]`, add a bucket name:
```
s3bucketname=firesim-snap
```
- Under `[builds]`, add a build recipe name (comment out other things).
```
firesim-boom-singlecore-no-nic-l2-llc4mb-ddr3-snap
```
- Undr `[agfistoshare]`, add a agfi name (comment out other things).
```
firesim-boom-singlecore-no-nic-l2-llc4mb-ddr3-snap
```

2. In `~/firesim/deploy/config_build_recipes.ini`,
- Add a build recipe.
```
[firesim-boom-singlecore-no-nic-l2-llc4mb-ddr3-snap]
DESIGN=FireSim
TARGET_CONFIG=DDR3FRFCFSLLC4MB_FireSimLargeBoomConfig
PLATFORM_CONFIG=F75MHz_BaseF1Config
instancetype=f1.2xlarge
deploytriplet=None
```

3. Build a new HW design (This will take a long time, ~10 hours).
```
firesim buildafi
```

After completed, you will get a new agfi number for your new HW design. \
Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.fires.im/en/latest/Building-a-FireSim-AFI.html) for more details.

## Running FireSim Simulations with SNAP

1. In `~/firesim/deploy/config_runtime.ini`,
- Change the default HW config.
```
defaulthwconfig=firesim-boom-singlecore-no-nic-l2-llc4mb-ddr3-snap
```

2. In `~/firesim/deploy/config_hwdb.ini`,
- Add a new HW database.
```
[firesim-boom-singlecore-no-nic-l2-llc4mb-ddr3-snap]
agfi=agfi-062b20613c52a2313 # replace with your agfi after HW build completes
deploytripletoverride=None
customruntimeconfig=None
```

3. Launch FPGA instance(s) following the [documentation](https://docs.fires.im/en/latest/Running-Simulations-Tutorial/index.html).

4. After an FPGA instance is launched, insert modules into the kernel.
```
# insmod cmap.ko
# insmod lbq.ko
```

5. Run binaries to trace!
